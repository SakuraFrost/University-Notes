# University Notes & Shenanigans
A somewhat organised collection of my notes, assignments, and ramblings from my time studying IT at my University.
You're welcomed to look around, but I don't have good naming conventions. >_>

## Notes
-   **Privacy First:** I've done my best to scrub any sensitive information from these files. If you spot anything I've missed, please do let me know!
-   **Feel Free to Borrow:** You're more than welcome to use these notes. If they help you out, that's fantastic! ;D
-   **Your Mileage May Vary:** I can't guarantee the usefulness or accuracy of everything here. These are, after all, a student's notes in the wild. :V
