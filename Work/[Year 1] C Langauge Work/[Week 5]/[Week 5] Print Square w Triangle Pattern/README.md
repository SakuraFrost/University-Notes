# Print Square-Triangle Pattern

Write a program to print a square pattern of size `n`.
In particular, the program first receives the size of the square `n`. It then prints out the square pattern.
Suppose `n=5`, the program will print the following pattern:

```
1 0 0 0 0 
1 1 0 0 0 
1 1 1 0 0 
1 1 1 1 0 
1 1 1 1 1
```

**Hint**: This problem can be solved using multiple inner loops.
